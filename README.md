# Shodanalyzer
Shodanalyzer is an OSINT tool which uses shodan.io platform to perform a passive scan for an IP address.

## Introduction
Shodanalyzer was born with the intention of creating a simple passive scanner. You don't have to manually scan with nmap a desired IP address, because it could be interpreted as violated legislation. Using shodan.io, this tool simply brings to you the open ports, open services, web technologies of a possible web-page, general information such as ISP provider, location, country and domains and also checks for CVEs.

## Installation

For instalation we just need Python3, clone this repository and install requirements.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cataiovita/shodanalyzer/
cd shodanalyzer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use shodanalyzer, you will need an account to shodan.io platform. Jump into ```https://account.shodan.io/register``` web-page and create an account.
To scan an IP address, the basic usage is:

```bash
python3 shodanalyzer.py -i IP_ADDRESS -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
```

Shodanalyzer will take the data out of shodan results.

There are seven possible field extracted:
 + **Open Ports**  
 + **Uncommon open ports** 
 + **Possible Vulnerabilities**
 + **General Information**
 + **Services**
 + **Technologies**
 + **Honeyscore**

## Informations obtained

### API Rating

Shodan.io will block you after consecutive ~10 requests if you're not using an account or valid credentials. So, for multiple IP searches, create an account on [shodan account](https://account.shodan.io/login) platform. To execute a shodanalyzer search, substitute the ``USERNAME`` and ``PASSWORD`` parameters. 

### Uncommon ports

Shodanalyzer also compares the open ports with a list of 1000 ports stored in ``tcp_ports`` and ``udp_ports`` files. Both files contains a top 1000 common ports on tcp and udp protocols.

### CVEs

There are a lot of possible CVEs found into a Shodan scan of a specific IP address. There's also a summary of every CVE that it's found. 

### Honeyscore

Shodan have also a honeypot detector: [honeyscore](https://honeyscore.shodan.io/). We can track a possible honeypot IP using this API. The honeyscore will be ranked with a maximum of 1.0 score. So, a score bigger and equals than 0.5/1.0 will be detected as a honeypot.
